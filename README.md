# TorZillaPrint

TorZillaPrint (TZP) aims to provide a comprehensive, all-in-one, fingerprinting test suite, nicely broken into suitable sections with relevant information together. Long term, the goal is to collect fingerprint data (no PII, and from Firefox and Tor Browser only), so as to analyze that data to see how many classifications each metric or section provides

### ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó DISCLAIMER ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó

The test is on it's own is not designed to re-identifying users. Do not think just because you can make it change that you "won". The fingerprint is simply a snapshot of data at any given time. Collected metrics can change for a number or reasons: such as zooming, resizing windows, moving windows, per site settings. Snapshots of fingerprints can still be linked after tha fact.

The test is to check Tor Browser and RFP are performing where known, and to dig into more areas of interest, and non-stable metrics are collected to provide as much information as possible for analysis

### üü™  What we do care about:
- Current Tor Browser and Firefox ESR or higher
- Tor Uplift, Fusion
- Comparing Tor Browser with Firefox
- First party only (for now)
- Lowering entropy (or poison pills where appropriate)
- Help. We'll take all the help we can get.

### üü©  What we might care about:
- Collecting data via submissions
- Expanding to include tests that require third parties
- Additional test pages for specific things

### üüß  What we don't care about:
- Other browsers
- Extensions (except those used in Tor Browser if they affect tests)
- Providing entropy figures

### üü•  Acknowledgments
